IconMaker_Obsolete
==================

An early version of the Icon Maker ++ app, made for iOS5. A lot of functionality and appearance was ruined by iOS7 changing how their controls look.

I'm uploading this app here as a part of my portfolio - this project demonstrates a lot of functionality:

-Graphics manipulation

-Object serialization

-Dropbox sync

-Core Data

Feel free to reuse parts of this for your own purposes.
